## How Does 💻 medifiller.py Work?

Let's dissect the `medifiller.py` file and understand how each part contributes to the functionality of the Medifiller web application:

### Imports and Setup 📦🔧
The file begins with necessary imports and setup procedures. Key libraries like Flask, weasyprint, and base64 are imported. Flask is utilized for creating the web application, while weasyprint is used for PDF generation. A secret key is generated for Flask session management.

### Global Variables and Handlers 🌐🤝
Global variables, including instances of `CustomerHandler` and `InstituteHandler`, are defined. These handlers manage customer and institute-related data. Additionally, variables like `ulogin`, `ilogin_`, and `uCustomer` are initialized for user login status and data.

### Routes and Views Definition 🛣️👀
Several routes are defined for different sections of the application, such as the home page, user dashboard, login, and PDF download. Corresponding view functions handle the logic for rendering templates and processing user input.

### User Section Handling 👤💼
The user section includes routes and views for actions like login, accessing the dashboard, submitting forms, and adding to an institute.

### Institute Section Handling 🏢💻
Routes and views for institute login, subscription management, and institute dashboard are implemented. The application supports communication between users and institutes.

### PDF Download Route 📄🔽
A route is dedicated to downloading user data in PDF format. The route retrieves user data, generates an HTML template, converts it to PDF using weasyprint, and provides the PDF file for download.

### Configuration and Secret Key 🤐🔑
The Flask application is configured with a secret key for session management. The secret key is generated at the beginning of the script using base64 encoding.

### Login Route and Functionality 🔐🚪
The login route handles both GET and POST requests. It processes user login data using `customerFunc.logSig` and sets up the user session upon successful login.

### Custom Routes and Views 🛣️🖥️
Additional routes and views are defined for terms and conditions, form rendering, institute data retrieval, and viewing user data.

### Code Execution ⚙️🚀
The script concludes with the standard Flask execution block, running the application on a specified port.

### Summary 🌐📊
`medifiller.py` orchestrates the Medifiller web application by defining routes, handling user interactions, and integrating customer and institute functionalities. It ensures secure login, seamless data management, and efficient communication between users and institutes.

The application's modular structure, use of Flask, and incorporation of external libraries contribute to its robust functionality. Users can navigate through the web interface to access dashboards, submit forms, and download data in PDF format.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment 🐍

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment. You can use `venv` or `virtualenv`. Here's an example using `venv`:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies 📦

1. While in the virtual environment, install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 4: Set Up Secret Key 🔑

1. Open the `medifiller.py` file in your project directory.

2. Locate the following line in `medifiller.py`:

   ```python
   sec_key = base64.b64encode(os.urandom(64)).decode('utf-8')
   app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = sec_key
   ```

3. The `SECRET_KEY` is used for session management. You can leave it as is, or customize it for added security.

### Step 5: Run the Application 🚀

1. In the terminal, while your virtual environment is active, run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python medifiller.py
   ```

2. The application should start, and you can access it by navigating to [http://127.0.0.1:5005/](http://127.0.0.1:5005/) in your web browser.
